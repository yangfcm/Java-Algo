 * @name CanConstruct
 * @description Given a target string and an array of strings.
 * The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the target can be
 * constructed by concatenating elements of the strs array.
 * You may use elements in strs as many times as needed.
 * e.g. You can use elements in ["ab", "abc", "cd", "def", "abcd"] to construct string "abcdef" ("abc" + "def"), so function returns true
 * But there is no way to construct "abcef", so function returns false.
