/**
 * Given a string, check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. Check is case
 * insensitive. e.g. Test TactCoa should return true because it has
 * permutations: "tacocat", "atcocta", which are palindromes. Of course, it is
 * impossible to generate all permutations of a string and test if it is a
 * palindrome one by one. To solve this, create a character map, with key is the
 * characters of the string and value is the occurence of the character. If the
 * string is a permutation of a palindrome, it must have at most one character
 * that has appeared in the string odd-number times.
