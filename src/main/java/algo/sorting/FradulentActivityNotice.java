/**
 * @name FradulentActivityNotice
 * @description Assume a bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fradulate account activity.
 * If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to the client's median spending for a trailing number of days,
 * they send the client a notification about potential fraud.
 * The bank doesn't send the client any notifications until they have at least that trailing number of prior days' transaction data.
 * Given the number of trailing days *d* and a client's total daily expenditures for a period of *n* days,
 * determine the number of times the client will receive a notification over all *n* days.
 * @example expenditure = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] d = 3, fradulentActivityNotice(expenditure, d) -> 1.
 * As d = 3, on the first 3 days, it just collects data. On day 4, trailing 3 days expenditures are [10, 20, 30].
 * The median is 20 and D4's expenditure is 40. Because 40 >= 20 * 2, client will get a notification.
 * Then on day 5, trailing 3 days expenditures are [20, 30, 40]. The median is 30 and D5's expenditure is 50.
 * Because 50 < 30 * 2, client will not get a notification on that day.
 * So, there will be 1 notification sent.

  /**
   * @param expenditure An array that represents N consecutive days of spending amount.
   * @param d From which day, notification is started.
   * @return The count of notifications triggered.
   * @solution Use the idea of counting sort.
   * Since you need to find out the median number in trailing n days, imagine there's a time window with width of d sliding along the array.
   * Use the example: expenditure = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] d = 3.
   * |10, 20, 30|, 40, 50
   * 10, |20, 30, 40|, 50
   * 10, 20, |30, 40, 50|
   * You need to find out the median number in this time window.
   * You don't need to really sort it and then get median number as it is time-consuming.
   * Just use the idea of counting sort to find out the number in the middle position.
