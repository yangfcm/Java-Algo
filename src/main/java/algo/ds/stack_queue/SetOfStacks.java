/**
 * @name SetOfStacks
 * @description Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack goes too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds a threshold.
 * Implement a data structure SetOfStacks to mimic this.
 * SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
 * SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack
 * Also implement a function popAt(index) to perform pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
 * Think about the sub-stack is not at full capacity when pop an element from it.
