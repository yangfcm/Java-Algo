 * @name MakeCandies
 * @description A candy factory wants to make n candies. To make candies, it needs machines and workers.
 * The factory starts with m machines and w workers. With that, it can make m * w candies each day.
 * By the end of day, the factory can decide whether to spend some of his candies to buy more machines or hire more workers.
 * Buying a machine or hiring a worker costs p units, and there is no limit to the number of machines or workers it can have.
 * The factory wants to minimize the number of days to produce the required number of candies at the end of a day.
 * Write a function to determine that number of days.
 * @example m = 3, w = 1, p = 2, n = 12 -> 3
 * Day 1: production = m * w = 3 * 1 = 3.
 * By the end of Day 1, factory can spend p = 2 of the production to hire another worker, so now w = 2 and net production is 3 - 2 = 1
 * Day 2: production = m * w + net production of day 1 = 3 * 2 + 1 = 7.
 * By the end of Day 2, factory can spend 3 (p = 2) of the production to buy new machines or hire new workers.
 * Let's use 1 to buy new machine and 2 to hire new workers, so now m = 4, w = 4, and the net production is 7 - 3*2 = 1.
 * Day 3: production = 4 * 4 = 16 > 12. So it needs 3 days to reach the target production.

  /**
   * @param m Starting number of machines
   * @param w Starging number of workers
   * @param p The unit cost to buy a machine or hire a worker
   * @param n The target production
   * @return Minimum days
   * @solution There are a couple of points to consider:
   * 1. Choice one: You can invest as much as you could from the production. The maximum investment is Math.floor( m*w / p)
   * 2. Choice two: Because expanding productivity can cost your production, you can also choose not to invest. In this case, the days to reach the target is: Math.ceil(n / (m*w))
   * 3. You need to compare which choice costs less days.
   * 4. If you choose to invest, it's possible that your production is so small that you can't afford even one single unit to invest.
   * That's fine. You'll just have to keep producing candies until it reaches a point that you can expand your productivity.
   * 5. When invest > 1(like Day 2 in the above example), we need to find ways to properly allocate it to buy machines and hire workers so that the production can achieve the most.
   * The implemention is in maxProduction() function.
